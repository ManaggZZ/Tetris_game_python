# 🎮 Tetris Game (Python + Pygame)

A classic **Tetris game built using Python and the Pygame library**.  
This project demonstrates core game development concepts such as game loops, grid-based movement, collision detection, rotation logic, and score tracking using an object-oriented approach.

## 🧩 Game Pieces (Tetrominoes)

The game includes all the standard Tetris pieces:

- **I** – Straight line piece  
- **O** – Square piece  
- **T** – T-shaped piece  
- **S** – Skewed piece  
- **Z** – Reverse skewed piece  
- **J** – L-shaped (left)  
- **L** – L-shaped (right)

Each piece can be rotated and moved within the grid while respecting collision rules.

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|----|-------|
| ⬅️ Left Arrow | Move tetromino left |
| ➡️ Right Arrow | Move tetromino right |
| ⬆️ Up Arrow | Rotate tetromino clockwise |
| ⬇️ Down Arrow | Move tetromino down faster |

## 🏆 Score System

- Clearing **1 row** increases the score by 100 points  
- Clearing **2 rows** increases the score by 300 points
- Clearing **more than 2 rows at once** increases the score by 500 points
- Using the down arrow to speed up the fall of tetrominoes increases score by 1 point per cell moved down
- Score updates in real time as rows are completed  

This encourages strategic placement of tetrominoes.
